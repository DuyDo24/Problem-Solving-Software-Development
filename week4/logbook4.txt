Initial Thoughts:
This question looks quite easy, my idea is to use two pointers starting from both ends and when they both encounter an A or a Z
i use the swap function so this ensures it doesnt just change from A to Z but also changes in the right position wihtout altering 
the rest of the string. Now im thinking about it im not sure how to move once one of them hits an A or Z and then move the other
pointer. im just going to try Initially using a while loop and then incrementing the l and r.
