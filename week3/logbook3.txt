QuickSums - 
Initial Thoughts:
This question looks very difficult but interesting because im not sure where to start, i have an obvious brute force solution 
so im going to attempt that, where i add a + in everypossible combination besides the start and end of course. Since the constraints
state that 10 would be the largest number, only 9 spot for combinations are possible making it 9! loops. Im thinking of using
recursion to break the number down and calling itself checking every time it recahes the target. Im going to try my best but
if i cant get it ill have to get some help.

Reflection:
