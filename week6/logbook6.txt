NiceOrUgly - 
Initial Thoughts:
This question i can tell is another dp/dfs quesiton where i go through the string first checking if it has 3 vowels in a row or 5 consanants
in a row, then if its a ? i call itself checking both cases where its a vowel or a consanant. Since the constraints are only 50 
a DFS or dp appraoch would work, ill try need to make a dfs contains the current index, number of current consecutive vowels 
and consanant as well as if a string found is nice or ugly. At the end of the string we just need to check if the boolean value of nice and ugly 
are true or not, i fboth true return 42.

Reflection:
This question took some time becasue i realised that brute force dfs wasnt going to work due tp the large constraints assuming 50 
"?". i didnt take that into account, so i had to add memoisation to optimise the code ensurign it doesnt recalculate calculations
that have already been done. I should of initially used a dp approach because although its quite similar its easier to understand
whats going on. The only hard part about this question was implementing the memoisation becasue it had to contain multiple variabels.


BlackAndWhiteSolitaire - 
Initial Thoughts:
This question looks quite easy proabbly becasue i have a cheese method of solving it, becasue there are low constraints and only
two options. i figure out the size and build out a repeating pattern of that size one that starts with white and one with black,
then i simply compare it with the origina string keeping count of how many times dies it differ and then just return the minimum 
difference.
