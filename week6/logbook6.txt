NiceOrUgly - 
Initial Thoughts:
This question i can tell is another dp/dfs quesiton where i go through the string first checking if it has 3 vowels in a row or 5 consanants
in a row, then if its a ? i call itself checking both cases where its a vowel or a consanant. Since the constraints are only 50 
a DFS or dp appraoch would work, ill try need to make a dfs contains the current index, number of current consecutive vowels 
and consanant as well as if a string found is nice or ugly. At the end of the string we just need to check if the boolean value of nice and ugly 
are true or not, i fboth true return 42.
