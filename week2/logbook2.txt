ChangingString -
Initial Thoughts:
At first i took me a lot of time to understand the question because im not very familiar with ascii but i get the concept of the 
question. I have to change K characters in A to be as close as it can to string B and then calculate the absolute value which
should be easy to do. The hard issue with this problem is figuring out which strings to change, my idea is to first calculate the 
biggest difference in inital string and change the biggest ones.

Reflection:
